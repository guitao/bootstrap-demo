                                        SKIPT enables users to buy and sell any spot, in any line by giving users the opportunity to find one another based on their location. If there are spots available to bid for in line, you can make an offer for that spot through SKIPT. Once your offer is accepted by the seller, you will be able to contact the seller and head to your new spot in line. To sell your spot in line, simply post your spot on SKIPT, set your minimum price, duration and you’re done. Your spot will automatically be available to buyers using SKIPT in that location.
